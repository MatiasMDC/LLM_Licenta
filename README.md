For my Bachelor’s Degree, I’ve decided to use a Large Language Model on a mobile device and test its applicability in the real world, specifically in emergency survival scenarios, where internet connectivity is usually not an option.

The system was designed to answer queries related to first aid, navigation, food procurement, shelter and other critical tasks, in the shortest amount of time possible. To achieve this, the model was trained on several datasets, containing relevant information about survival in the wilderness.

Deployment was made possible with several optimization techniques to minimize the computational and storage demands of a mobile device, without sacrificing response quality or contextual accuracy.
